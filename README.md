# 🎓 Student Feedback Data Analysis  
### FutureIntern – Task 3 | FUTURE_DS_03  

## 📘 Project Overview  
This project analyzes student feedback data collected via Google Forms.  
Originally, the ratings were on a **1–10 scale**, which were standardized to a **1–5 scale** for consistent analysis and visualization.  
The goal is to extract key insights and visualize satisfaction trends across different aspects of teaching and course structure.  

## 🧩 Dataset Description  
**File Used:** `student_feedback.xlsx`  

**Columns Included:**
- Well versed with the subject  
- Explains concepts in an understandable way  
- Use of presentations  
- Degree of difficulty of assignments  
- Solves doubts willingly  
- Structuring of the course  
- Provides support for students going above and beyond  
- Course recommendation based on relevance  

**Rating Scale Adjusted:**  
Originally `1–10` → Converted to `1–5` (for uniform interpretation of satisfaction levels).

## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries  
- **Python**  
- **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation  
- **NumPy** – Numerical computation  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **OpenPyXL** – Excel file handling  

## 📊 Key Steps Performed  
1. Cleaned dataset (handled nulls & duplicates)  
2. Scaled all ratings from 1–10 to 1–5  
3. Calculated overall satisfaction per student  
4. Created multiple visualizations:
   - Average rating per question  
   - Rating distribution (1–5)  
   - Correlation heatmap of feedback categories  
   - Radar chart showing course performance areas  
5. Summarized top-rated and low-rated areas



## 📈 Insights Summary  
- Overall satisfaction: **~4.0 / 5**  
- Top strengths: *Explains concepts clearly*, *Solves doubts willingly*  
- Needs improvement: *Degree of difficulty of assignments*  


## 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
- Practical experience in **data cleaning and scaling**  
- Visual storytelling using **Python visualization tools**  
- Understanding of **correlation & satisfaction patterns**
